This an emacs config designed to get an advanced development environment for clojure and (eventually) ruby going quickly. Intended for pure emacs and it's gui installs. I'm avoiding elpa, due to the lagtime in package updates. Submodules are used when availabe. This includes, paredit, rainbow parens, and some other shit.

## Installation
1. backup ~/.emacs.d if there is anything you wish to keep
2. git clone git://github.com/lancepantz/.emacs.d.git from your home directory
3. cd .emacs.d
4. git submodule init
5. git submodule update

## User specific configuration
User specific settings go in ~/.emacs
