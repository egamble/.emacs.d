This is forked from git://github.com/lancepantz/.emacs.d.git, lancepantz' personal emacs config set up primarily for clojure and ruby. Intended for pure emacs and its gui installs. It avoids elpa, due to the lagtime in package updates. Submodules are used when available. This includes paredit, rainbow parens, and others.

## Installation
1. backup ~/.emacs.d if there is anything you wish to keep
2. git clone git://github.com/egamble/.emacs.d.git from your home directory
3. cd .emacs.d
4. git submodule init
5. git submodule update

## User specific configuration
User specific settings go in ~/.emacs
