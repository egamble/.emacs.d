Emacs 24 is required for this init.el. I'm using it on Mac OS X 10.8 with a customized emacs 24.1 from [here](https://github.com/xajler/emacs24-macosx-lion-fullscreen).

## Installation
1. Back up ~/.emacs.d if there is anything you wish to keep.
2. `git clone git://github.com/egamble/.emacs.d.git` from your home directory.
3. Either `cp ~/.emacs.d/.emacs ~` or merge ~/.emacs.d/.emacs with your existing ~/.emacs
