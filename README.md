This is forked and extensively modified from [lancepantz' emacs config](https://github.com/lancepantz/.emacs.d).

I'm using it on Mac OS X Mountain Lion with a customized Emacs 24.1 from [here](https://github.com/xajler/emacs24-macosx-lion-fullscreen).

## Installation
1. Back up ~/.emacs.d if there is anything you wish to keep.
2. git clone git://github.com/egamble/.emacs.d.git from your home directory.
3. cd .emacs.d
4. git submodule init
5. git submodule update

## User specific configuration
User specific settings go in ~/.emacs
